# GETTING STARTED
You need to install Astro and TailwindCSS, since they are the technologies used for the Front-End of the project.

For Astro 🚀
```
pnpm create astro@latest
```

For TailwindCSS 🎨
```
npx astro add tailwind
npx tailwindcss init
```

>[!TIP]
> In fact, you can always check the 🗃️ **package.json** file to check the dependencies and the version used.

Once you have the project ready, 🚀 just run Astro locally with the following command:
```
pnpm run dev
```
